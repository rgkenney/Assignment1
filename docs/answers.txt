g)

h)
 I) Inheritance refers to an object taking properties from a parent object.
 II) Polymorphism refers to different kinds of objects utilizing the same interface.
 III) Encapsulation refers to the grouping of data and functions into a class.

i)
 The Dictator and Lieutenants workflow merges the work done by the developers done in 
 multiple repositories rather than all at once by the integration manager.

j)
 Parts are successfully integrated before being pushed to the master repository in the
 Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, meaning it is much less likely to break when 100
 developers are pushing their changes.

Question 5
 RoleGame uses both polymorphism and encapsulation. All weapon types are children of the
 Weapon class, and all have their own versions of the hit function. When called, the hit
 function executed is based off of the object that invoked it. Encapsulation is present
 in the form of the weapon types, as they are created through classes. These classes
 contain the data and functions for each weapon type, thus encapsulation is present in
 RoleGame.
